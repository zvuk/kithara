# cargo-tarpaulin configuration for code coverage
# https://github.com/xd009642/tarpaulin
#
# Note: Most settings are provided via CLI in .github/workflows/coverage.yml
# This file defines only output formats and directories

[report]
# Output formats
out = ["Html", "Xml", "Lcov"]

[report.html]
# HTML output directory
output-dir = "target/coverage/html"

[report.xml]
# XML (Cobertura) output directory for codecov
output-dir = "target/coverage"

[report.lcov]
# LCOV output directory
output-dir = "target/coverage"

# Note: On macOS, tarpaulin has limited support.
# Use Docker or run in GitHub Actions (Linux) for accurate coverage:
#   docker run --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
#     -v "${PWD}:/volume" \
#     xd009642/tarpaulin:latest \
#     cargo tarpaulin
