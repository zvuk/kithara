//! # kithara-assets
//!
//! Persistent disk assets store for Kithara.
//!
//! ## Public contract
//!
//! The explicit public contract is the [`Assets`] trait.
//! Everything else should be considered an implementation detail.
//!
//! ## Key mapping (normative)
//!
//! Resources are addressed by strings chosen by higher layers:
//! - `asset_root`: e.g. hex(AssetId) / ResourceHash
//! - `rel_path`: e.g. `media/audio.mp3`, `segments/0001.m4s`
//!
//! Disk mapping is:
//! - `<cache_root>/<asset_root>/<rel_path>`
//!
//! Assets does not "invent" paths; it only enforces safety (no absolute paths, no `..`, no empty
//! segments).
//!
//! ## Auto-pin (lease) semantics
//!
//! All resources opened through the leasing decorator (`LeaseAssets`) are automatically pinned by
//! `asset_root` for the lifetime of the returned handle.
//!
//! The pin is expressed as an RAII guard stored inside [`AssetResource`]. Drop the handle to release
//! the pin.
//!
//! ## Global index (best-effort)
//!
//! `_index/state.json` is a small, atomic file (temp → rename) used as best-effort metadata.
//! Filesystem remains the source of truth; the index may be missing and can be rebuilt later.
