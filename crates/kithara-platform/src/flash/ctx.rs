//! The flash engine's ONE per-thread context. Every thread-local the engine
//! consults lives in the single [`ThreadCtx`] cell: the two-flag time mode
//! (`ambient` / `active`), the quiescence credit, the async-poll depth and the
//! dedicated-pacer flag. Fields are private — the mode is written only by the
//! RAII scopes in `api.rs` (via [`push_ambient`] / [`push_active`] /
//! [`restore_mode`]); credit / poll-depth / dedicated only by the credit
//! functions in `system/credit.rs`, each touching ONLY its own field (a
//! pooled thread's credit reset must not clobber the mode of the scope
//! around it).
//!
//! # LIFO premise (whole-`Mode` save/restore)
//!
//! A mode scope saves and restores the WHOLE [`Mode`] (`Copy`, cheap), not
//! just the flag it sets. That is equivalent to a per-field restore ONLY
//! under strictly LIFO nesting of mode scopes on a thread — which every
//! current holder satisfies: the per-poll wrapper guards
//! (`WithAmbient`/`FlashDynamic`), the spawn-bracket scopes, the prod
//! `#[kithara::flash]` guard and the test macro's body-held ambient scope
//! (sync/wasm emissions only; async-native bodies carry `with_ambient`
//! per-poll instead). A non-LIFO holder (a scope outliving a sibling created
//! after it) would silently restore a stale flag — e.g. drag `ambient = true`
//! into foreign code, re-latching stateful primitives constructed there.
//!
//! ENFORCED, not assumed: [`push_active`]/[`push_ambient`] return a
//! [`ModeSnapshot`] carrying both the previous and the just-set [`Mode`];
//! [`restore_mode`] `debug_assert`s the current mode still equals the set one.
//! Since the only mode writers are the RAII scopes, a mismatch on drop means
//! a non-LIFO drop: an interleaved later scope is still alive, or one already
//! restored over this scope's mode. The check fires at the first
//! VALUE-VISIBLE violation (debug assertions are on in the gate's
//! test-release profile); a non-LIFO drop that restores the very same `Mode`
//! value is masked by equality and surfaces only at the later scope whose
//! state it corrupted.
