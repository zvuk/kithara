# kithara-xtask-core

Reusable, config-driven command core for `cargo xtask` build tooling. It holds
the project-agnostic commands so several workspaces can share one implementation
and keep only their own project-specific commands in a thin `xtask` binary.

Contracts and invariants live in [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md); this file is the
overview.

## Commands

Exposed through the `CoreCommand` subcommand enum:

- `lint` — architectural / style / idiomatic fitness functions (`arch`, `style`,
  `idioms`), ratcheted against a baseline. *(feature `lint`)*
- `format` — Rust, Cargo manifests, TOML, JSON, and Markdown formatting.
- `typos`, `similarity`, `ast-grep` — thin wrappers over the matching CLIs with
  the workspace config pinned.
- `manifest`, `orphans` — Cargo manifest hygiene and per-package orphan checks.
- `test` — workspace tests through `cargo nextest` with lane / backend / feature
  selection.
- `health` — aggregated workspace health report.
- `quality` — rstest / unimock / trait-mock audits.
- `scope` — translate scope tokens to tool-specific flags.
- `perf-compare` — compare hotpath timing tables against a baseline.
- `viz` — architecture visualization. *(feature `viz`)*

## Consuming it

Add the dependency and flatten `CoreCommand` into your own bin's subcommand
enum, keeping your project-specific commands alongside it:

```rust
#[derive(clap::Subcommand)]
enum Command {
    #[command(flatten)]
    Core(kithara_xtask_core::CoreCommand),
    // ... your project-specific commands
}

fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let cli = Cli::parse();
    let ctx = kithara_xtask_core::Ctx::load()?;
    match cli.command {
        Command::Core(cmd) => kithara_xtask_core::run(&cmd, &ctx),
        // ... your arms
    }
}
```

## Configuration

Everything project-specific comes from `.config/xtask.toml`, parsed once into
`Ctx::config`. The file is optional: a project with none gets documented code
defaults, and `project.name` is derived from cargo metadata. Unknown top-level
sections are a typed error (`deny_unknown_fields`); a project puts its own
sections under `[ext.*]`, which the core passes through untouched.

The shared `[workspace-scan] exclude` globs drop directories (media trees,
virtualenvs, …) from the scanning commands.

## Features

- `lint` (default) — the syn-based `arch`/`style`/`idioms` lint family.
- `viz` (default) — architecture visualization.

Both are on by default; `--no-default-features` drops those command families for
a project that only wants format/test/health and friends.
